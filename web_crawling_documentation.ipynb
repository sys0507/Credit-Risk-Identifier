        "  ** The Default Rate is a critical metric in loan portfolio analysis, reflecting the proportion of loans that borrowers fail to repay as agreed within a specified period. Below is a deeper exploration of the Default Rate based on the provided information and general financial principles:\n",
        "Expanded Definition\n",
        "\n",
        "Default Rate: Expressed as a percentage, it measures loans that enter \"default status,\" typically when a borrower misses payments for a prolonged period (e.g., 90+ days past due, though definitions vary by lender or loan type).\n",
        "Timeframe: The rate is calculated over a specific period, such as 12 months, 24 months, or the loanâ€™s lifecycle. For example, a 15% default rate over 24 months means 15% of loans issued became delinquent within that time.\n",
        "Calculation:\n",
        "$$\\text{Default Rate} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Number of Loans in Default}}{\\text{Total Number of Loans Issued}} \\right) \\times 100$$\n",

        "Range (8.5% - 20.0%):\n",
        "\n",
        "Low End (8.5%, Home Improvement): Indicates loans for home improvement are relatively low-risk, likely due to stable collateral (e.g., property) or borrower profiles with better creditworthiness.\n",
        "High End (20.0%, Venture): Suggests venture loans are high-risk, possibly due to the speculative nature of business startups or volatile cash flows.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Risk Indicator:\n",
        "\n",
        "A higher default rate signals greater credit risk, impacting lender profitability and portfolio health.\n",
        "The 40% weight in the final risk score underscores its importance in assessing loan risk compared to other metrics (e.g., delinquency rates, credit scores).\n",

        "\n",
        "Loan Type Implications:\n",
        "\n",
        "Safer Loans (e.g., Home Improvement): Likely have stricter underwriting criteria, lower loan-to-value ratios, or are secured by tangible assets.\n",

        "Loan Characteristics: Interest rate, loan term, secured vs. unsecured.\n",
        "Economic Conditions: Recessions or high unemployment can increase default rates.\n",
        "Loan Purpose: As seen, venture loans are riskier than home improvement loans due to differing repayment reliability.\n",

        "Benchmarking:\n",
